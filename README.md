# DeepLearning
This is repository holds code and documentation of work I have done in a 16-week 4/Senior level **Deep Learning in Python** class. ICP's represent weekly assignments practicing in code foundational machine and deep learning concepts.

All concepts and practice done in the ICP lead to using those techniques creatively in a self-choosen larger scale Kaggle Competition project. Me and my partner choose COVID-19 Global Forecasting with the purpose of using current global data by country to predict future confirmed cases and fatalities of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Each ICP and the Final Project have Wikis that go through things learned, thoughts, explainations, code run-throughs, etc.
